{"Questions":[{"Question":"Which of the following can be used to find hosts on LAN?","Explanation":"An ARP scan involves iterating over every IP address on a LAN using the ARP protocol to force a reply from any systems.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Port scanning","Correct":false},{"Text":"ARP scan","Correct":true},{"Text":"Ping sweep","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Using UDP to port scan is easier than using TCP.","Explanation":"TCP is easier to use when port scanning as if a service is available it will always reply with a SYN/ACK packet.

Visitors can click this link to make the server to reflect the attack onto them.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"An attack where content saved on a page is reflected onto visitors of the website.","Correct":false},{"Text":"An attack where the attacker is able to view a visitor's activity by reflecting their data to the attacker.","Correct":false},{"Text":"An attack where a link contains the attack to be reflected onto visitors.","Correct":true},{"Text":"An attack where a link automatically downloads data onto a visitor's device.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Which of the following are security options on WIFI:","Explanation":"WIFI networks can be configured to either have no security at all or to have one of several different authentication methods. Some of these methods include using an access list, enterprise authentication or PSK (Pre-shared key).","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"No security at all.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Using an access list, based off provided MAC addresses.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Using enterprise authentication.","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the above.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"What are some characteristics of an open WIFI network?","Explanation":"Open WIFI networks are networks that do not have a password, with traffic also not being encrypted by default.
