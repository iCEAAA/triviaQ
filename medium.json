{"Questions":[{"Question":"Which of the following can be used to find hosts on LAN?","Explanation":"An ARP scan involves iterating over every IP address on a LAN using the ARP protocol to force a reply from any systems.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Port scanning","Correct":false},{"Text":"ARP scan","Correct":true},{"Text":"Ping sweep","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the options.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Using UDP to port scan is easier than using TCP.","Explanation":"TCP is easier to use when port scanning as if a service is available it will always reply with a SYN/ACK packet.
