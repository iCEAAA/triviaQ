{"Questions":[{"Question":"Which best describes the way Nmap undergoes network mapping?","Explanation":"Nmap initiates a three-way handshake with systems in a network, before purposely not conforming to the TCP standard to get a response from a system.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"By pinging all IP addresses on a network.","Correct":false},{"Text":"By analysing traffic moving across a network to track active hosts.","Correct":false},{"Text":"By initiating a three-way handshake with systems.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true?","Explanation":"UDP port scanning can be slower than TCP port scanning as it may be difficult to get a response from some services.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"TCP port scanning can involve sending a packet to all 65536 ports.","Correct":false},{"Text":"UDP port scanning is faster than TCP port scanning.","Correct":true},{"Text":"If no reply is returned, it can be assumed that the packet was filtered or that the port is closed.","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"The strcpy() function in C is:","Explanation":"The function strcpy() is used in C to copy a string into another variable. It is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks as it does not ensure that the lengths of both inputs are the same length. Therefore, if a string is copied into a variable that has less memory allocated to it, the CPU will override excess memory with the string's characters.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Safe to use when trying to copy strings due to its in-built checks.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Dangerous to use without input sanitisation.","Correct":true},{"Text":"Can protect against buffer overflow attacks.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Both a and c.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Vulnerability scanners:","Explanation":"Vulnerability scanners are capable of scanning a network for known vulnerabilities, but cannot reliably protect a network from unknown vulnerabilities. As a result of this, they cannot definitively protect a network from every attempted cyberattack.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Scan a network for known vulnerabilities in software or configurations.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Login to systems, if allowed to, to scan for vulnerabilities.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Protect a network from all attempted cyberattacks.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Both a and b.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"When monitoring a network, the context of signals from a failed attack is irrelevant as the attack can be considered noise.","Explanation":"The context of signals from any attempted attack can be used to determine many different things. For example, if the attack originates from a trusted IP address then the network is trusting a malicious IP address.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"A compromised host can allow access to other networks, using lateral movement, by:","Explanation":"Pivoting involves using a compromised host to access other networks. A buffer overflow and DDoS attack do not achieve the same via lateral movement.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Pivoting","Correct":true},{"Text":"A DDoS attack","Correct":false},{"Text":"Using a buffer overflow","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the above","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"An IDOR vulnerability is best described as when:","Explanation":"An IDOR (Insecure direct object reference) vulnerability occurs when authorisation requirements are improperly implemented. This allows for users to access documents that shouldn't be able to be viewed, through methods that can be as simple as changing a parameter.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Files are stored in the wrong location, resulting in incorrect files being served.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Resources are inaccessible by anyone due to incorrect authorisation requirements.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Authorisation requirements are not implemented for accessing resources.","Correct":true},{"Text":"None of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Assuming there is improper input sanitisation, which of the following requests will allow access into every row in a table?","Explanation":"The request \"/users?id=53' OR '1'='1\" will generate a query that appears as \"SELECT * FROM Users where id='53' OR '1'='1' \", thus allowing access into all rows within the table.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"/users?id=53' OR '1'='1","Correct":true},{"Text":"/users?id=53' OR 1=1","Correct":false},{"Text":"/users?id=53' OR '1'='1'","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Hiding the SSID of a wireless network is a secure way to prevent access into a network?","Explanation":"Clients need to broadcast information about a network with a hidden SSID to join it. As a result of this, if an attacker sniffs the traffic from a client they can discover the name of the network to join it.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true?","Explanation":"MAC address filtering is not entirely secure as attackers can spoof their MAC address to match those of devices communicating in the network.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Open WIFI networks are susceptible to packet sniffing.","Correct":false},{"Text":"MAC address filtering is a secure way of enforcing authentication.","Correct":true},{"Text":"Hiding the SSID of a network will prevent the network's name from being broadcast.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Enterprise authentication is a type of security used for WIFI networks.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Password cracking is:","Explanation":"Password cracking is an attack in which computing power is used to guess the password that matches a user's hashed password. It is typically an offline attack that may also be time-consuming.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"An attack that can only be performed online.","Correct":false},{"Text":"An attack that can be performed offline.","Correct":true},{"Text":"An attack that is always achieved in a short manner of time.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Both a and c.","Correct":false}]}]}
