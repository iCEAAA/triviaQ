{"Questions":[{"Question":"Passphrases are ineffective passwords as they are easily guessed.","Explanation":"Passphrases are effective as passwords as they are easier to type and remember, but also harder to crack than shorter passwords.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true about password managers?","Explanation":"Password managers are typically used to store all of a user's passwords in one location. Their main purpose is not to automatically change the passwords that a user uses.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"They can sometimes generate passwords for users.","Correct":false},{"Text":"They are mainly used to automatically change a user's passwords.","Correct":true},{"Text":"They are mainly used to store all of a user's passwords.","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"If a user's password manager is compromised their passwords are still fully protected.","Explanation":"A user's passwords can be exposed if their password manager is compromised, despite this, password managers are still a far safer alternative to using the same password everywhere.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Password-less systems are systems without any form of authentication at all.","Explanation":"Password-less systems often include other forms of authentication, such as biometric authentication.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Multi-factor authentication allows for users to:","Explanation":"Multi-factor authentication is used to enforce security by making users use multiple authentication methods to verify themselves.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Access a system without using a password.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Use multiple authentication methods to verify users.","Correct":true},{"Text":"Increase the speed in which authentication takes.","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Which of the following are not methods usable in multi-factor authentication?","Explanation":"SMS services, QR codes and biometric authentication are all valid ways to enforce multi-factor authentication.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"SMS services","Correct":false},{"Text":"QR codes","Correct":false},{"Text":"Biometric authentication","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the above.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"DAC is used to ensure that users do not have to multi-factor authenticate.","Explanation":"DAC (Discretionary access control) is applied to decide whether a user should need multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication is often needed when a new login location appears, when a significant action is being performed or when a new device is used.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"An administrator account can be more easily compromised if:","Explanation":"An administrator account can more easily be compromised under many circumstances. Some examples include having no multi-factor authentication, using the default password or writing down passwords publicly.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"An employee who knows the password writes it down publicly.","Correct":false},{"Text":"No multi-factor authentication exists.","Correct":false},{"Text":"The account's password has never changed from the default.","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the above.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"Credential stuffing is an attack in which leaked credentials are used against other services to access accounts.","Explanation":"Credential stuffing can be used to hack into accounts, especially when users reuse passwords in multiple locations.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Password cracking is:","Explanation":"Password cracking is an attack in which computing power is used to guess the password that matches a user's hashed password. It is typically an offline attack that may also be time-consuming.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"An attack that can only be performed online.","Correct":false},{"Text":"An attack that can be performed offline.","Correct":true},{"Text":"An attack that is always achieved in a short manner of time.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Both a and c.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"A system's credentials cannot be extracted, even if a user is currently logged into the system when it is compromised.","Explanation":"An attacker can potentially extract the credentials used for a system if administrator access is granted to it while it is compromised.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]}]}
