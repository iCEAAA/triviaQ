{"Questions":[{"Question":"WIFI signals tend to reach everyone within the range of the signal. This can be problematic as attackers can listen for packets traveling in the network.","Explanation":"Attackers can sniff the network to listen for any traffic being transmitted throughout the network.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"WIFI can potentially allow attackers to:","Explanation":"Attackers can access a user's internal applications, exploit firmware vulnerabilities that are unpatched and even sniff packets across a network.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Access a user's internal applications.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Exploit vulnerabilities in the firmware of WIFI devices.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Sniff packets across a network.","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the options.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"Which of the following are security options on WIFI:","Explanation":"WIFI networks can be configured to either have no security at all or to have one of several different authentication methods. Some of these methods include using an access list, enterprise authentication or PSK (Pre-shared key).","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"No security at all.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Using an access list, based off provided MAC addresses.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Using enterprise authentication.","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the options.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"Some network cards allow for packets to be created with a source MAC address that is different from its own MAC address.","Explanation":"Many WIFI attacks rely on the ability to create packets with a different source MAC address to achieve their effects.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"What are some characteristics of an open WIFI network?","Explanation":"Open WIFI networks are networks that do not have a password, with traffic also not being encrypted by default. These are more susceptible to packet sniffing due to this lack of encryption.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"The traffic within the network is automatically encrypted.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Is a WIFI network with no password.","Correct":true},{"Text":"Is immune to packet sniffing from attackers.","Correct":false},{"Text":"The network has no password and has automatically encrypted traffic.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Hiding the SSID of a wireless network is a secure way to prevent access into a network?","Explanation":"Clients need to broadcast information about a network with a hidden SSID to join it. As a result of this, if an attacker sniffs the traffic from a client they can discover the name of the network to join it.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true?","Explanation":"MAC address filtering is not entirely secure as attackers can spoof their MAC address to match those of devices communicating in the network.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Open WIFI networks are susceptible to packet sniffing.","Correct":false},{"Text":"MAC address filtering is a secure way of enforcing authentication.\n","Correct":true},{"Text":"Hiding the SSID of a network will prevent the network's name from being broadcast.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Enterprise authentication is a type of security used for WIFI networks.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not a valid protocol used for PSK?","Explanation":"WPA and WEP are both valid protocols used for authentication via PSK.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"WPA","Correct":false},{"Text":"WEP","Correct":false},{"Text":"WEP3","Correct":true},{"Text":"None of the options.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"WEP is a newer protocol used for PSK. It is more secure against cyberattacks than WPA.","Explanation":"WEP is an older protocol used for PSK authentication, that is no longer used as it is insecure and susceptible to attacks.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Attackers can infiltrate a WPA enabled network by using a password cracker.","Explanation":"WPA can still be cracked by using a password cracker. Despite this, networks with strong passwords will still be considerably difficult to crack.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Clients may automatically connect to fake WIFI networks if they use the same SSID as a known network.","Explanation":"Some devices may automatically connect to the fake networks if the SSID is the same. This opens the potential for attackers to sniff traffic or manipulate a user's traffic.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true?","Explanation":"All of the options are not true. Open WIFI networks do not tend to automatically encrypt traffic within it. MAC address filtering is insecure as MAC addresses are easy to spoof. NFC is typically used for wireless data transmission.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Open WIFI networks typically automatically encrypt any communication on the network.","Correct":false},{"Text":"MAC address filtering is insecure as it is impossible to know which addresses to allow and deny.","Correct":false},{"Text":"NFC is typically used for wired data transmission.","Correct":false},{"Text":"All of the options.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"Enterprise authentication involves:","Explanation":"The options provided were descriptions for PSK authentication, hidden SSID networks or MAC address filtering.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Configuring a network with a password, using protocols such as WPA or WEP.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Hiding the SSID of a network.","Correct":false},{"Text":"Filtering users based on their MAC address.","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the options.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"WIFI stems from which of the following protocols?","Explanation":"WIFI follows the IEEE 802.11 family of networking standards.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"IEEE 802.3","Correct":false},{"Text":"IEEE 802.11","Correct":true},{"Text":"IEEE 802.1","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the options","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"The name of a wireless network is also known as the:","Explanation":"The name of a wireless network is also known as the SSID, or Service Set Identifier.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Service Set Identifier","Correct":true},{"Text":"WPA3","Correct":false},{"Text":"MAC address","Correct":false},{"Text":"NFC","Correct":false}]}]}
