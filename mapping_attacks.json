Services may have vulnerabilities that can then be exploited by these attackers.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Using UDP to port scan is easier than using TCP.","Explanation":"TCP is easier to use when port scanning as if a service is available it will always reply with a SYN/ACK packet. UDP port scanning can often be more difficult as services may require a specific input.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Which of the following is not true?","Explanation":"UDP port scanning can be slower than TCP port scanning as it may be difficult to get a response from some services.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"TCP port scanning can involve sending a packet to all 65536 ports.","Correct":false},{"Text":"UDP port scanning is faster than TCP port scanning.","Correct":true},{"Text":"If no reply is returned, it can be assumed that the packet was filtered or that the port is closed.","Correct":false},{"Text":"None of the above.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"UDP port scanning can rely on using SYN/ACK packets if no response is received.","Explanation":"As UDP port scanning is performed on UDP ports, the TCP protocol cannot be used when UDP port scanning fails.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Faster scans have a higher chance of being detected by IDS systems due to their speed.","Explanation":"A fast scan might overwhelm a system, while a slower scan is more likely to go undetected.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"T0 is the fastest speed option for port scanning on Nmap.","Explanation":"T0 is the slowest speed option on Nmap.
